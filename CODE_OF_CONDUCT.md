 # Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
 
 ## Our Pledge
 
 We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
 
 ## Our Standards
 
 Positive behaviors include using welcoming and inclusive language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community, and showing empathy towards other community members.
 
 Unacceptable behaviors include sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances, trolling or insulting comments, personal or political attacks, public or private harassment, publishing others’ private information without explicit permission, and other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.
 
 ## Scope
 
 This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.
 
 ## Enforcement
 
 Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers. Preferably contact us privately via the repository’s Security tab or GitHub discussions. For security issues, follow SECURITY.md instead of opening a public issue.
 
 All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team will maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
 
 ## Enforcement Guidelines
 
 1. Correction — Private warning; clarification of expectations.
 2. Warning — Official warning with consequences for continued behavior.
 3. Temporary Ban — Temporary ban from interactions/public communication.
 4. Permanent Ban — Permanent ban for repeated or severe violations.
